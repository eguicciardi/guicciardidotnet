# Emanuele Guicciardi - Personal website

This is the *n-th* try to rebuild my website. This time the very likely to be left unfinished project is based on [Remix](https://remix.run/) and it's my first serious attempt to learn something on modern fronted tooling.

**Why Remix?** I don't know yet. I'd like to try something new and it seems quite approachable with a not bloated code base.

## Local development

Feel free to fork/clone this repository and use it. If you need to spin it up locally just make sure to have all the dependencies installed and npmrundev it.

```bash
npi i # To install the dependencies
npm run dev # To run it on localhost
```
